# code
I uploaded the private code of Flammingberg's web shop before their initial release because they did not agree with my statement that they should fix the outstanding vulnerabilities instead of using security by obscurity.
Hopefully by making all their code available to everyone they will be forced to patch them.

Anyway, I have quit my job there, so don't care too much but thought I'd throw the code online anyway.
